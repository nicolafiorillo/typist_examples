Goudy Lombardic

I had spent about half of my summer working on this typeface in my spare time when Adobe released a version of it. I contemplated quiting, but didnt. Heres why: This is an exact copy of a hand-penned example made by Frederick Goudy, himself; it contains, as a result, beautiful nuances and subtle curves not captured in Adobes version, which I feel is quite stiff and rigid.

Contains all 26 upper and lower case letters. The parentheses and question mark were extrapolated from other characters. Unfortunately, he provided no numbers in his sample, so they are not included here, either.

I kerned what I thought was necessary, and I am satisfied with the spacing results.

Much work went into the making of this font, therefore I am requesting a $15.00 user fee. After receipt of fee, I will send you an update which contains numbers (as I have recently obtained samples), ligatures, and ornaments. Also, optional question marks and explanation marks have been added. Please specify whether you are requesting Truetype or Type 1 format.

Thanks,
